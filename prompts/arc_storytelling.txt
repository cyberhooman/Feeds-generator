## STORYTELLING NARRATIVE ARC

You are creating STORY-DRIVEN content. Your carousel MUST follow classic narrative structure to captivate and engage.

### SLIDE STRUCTURE (7 slides):

[SLIDE 1 - BEAT: HOOK]
- Start IN MEDIAS RES or with INTRIGUE
- Drop reader into a moment, a scene, a question
- "The day I lost everything..." / "She said one thing that changed my life..."
- Create immediate curiosity
- Visual mood: DRAMATIC, ATTENTION-GRABBING, MYSTERIOUS

[SLIDE 2 - BEAT: TENSION_BUILD]
- RAISE THE STAKES - what's at risk?
- Build anticipation and suspense
- Add context that makes the conflict matter
- "But I didn't know what was coming..."
- Visual mood: TENSE, SUSPENSEFUL, ANTICIPATION

[SLIDE 3 - BEAT: CONFLICT_PEAK]
- The CLIMAX - the hardest moment
- The confrontation, the failure, the breaking point
- Maximum emotional intensity
- Don't resolve yet - let them feel it
- Visual mood: INTENSE, PEAK EMOTION, DRAMATIC

[SLIDE 4 - BEAT: RESOLUTION]
- The TURN - how things started changing
- The first glimmer of hope or breakthrough
- Show the transformation beginning
- Visual mood: RELIEF, TRANSFORMATION, SHIFT

[SLIDE 5 - BEAT: RESOLUTION]
- Complete the resolution
- Show the new reality, the outcome
- The "after" to the "before" of slides 1-3
- Visual mood: PEACE, COMPLETION, NEW STATE

[SLIDE 6 - BEAT: TAKEAWAY]
- The LESSON - what did this story teach?
- Universal truth extracted from personal experience
- "This taught me that..."
- Visual mood: WISE, REFLECTIVE, CONTEMPLATIVE

[SLIDE 7 - BEAT: CTA]
- Invite reader INTO the story
- "Have you experienced this?"
- Call to action that connects, not just promotes
- Visual mood: TEXT-ONLY (no image)

### VISUAL GUIDELINES FOR STORYTELLING CONTENT:

DO USE:
- Movie/TV scene stills that match the emotion
- Cinematic photography
- Anime or cartoon scenes (if style-consistent)
- Images that SHOW don't TELL
- Scene-setting imagery

DO NOT USE:
- Random memes (break narrative immersion)
- Generic stock photos (feel disconnected)
- Mixing styles (don't go cartoon → photo → meme)
- Decorative images that don't serve the story

### STYLE CONSISTENCY RULE:

Once you establish a visual style (cartoon, cinematic, photo), MAINTAIN it throughout:
- If slide 2 uses a cartoon scene → slides 3-6 should also use cartoon
- If slide 2 uses movie stills → slides 3-6 should also use movie stills
- This creates visual coherence and professional feel

### OUTPUT FORMAT:

For each slide, include the beat marker:

```
[SLIDE 1 - BEAT: HOOK]
Your slide content here...

[SLIDE 2 - BEAT: TENSION_BUILD]
Your slide content here...
```

This beat marker helps the visual system select narratively appropriate imagery.

### NARRATIVE ENERGY FLOW:

The tension should flow like this:
1. HIGH-INTRIGUING (hook) →
2. RISING (tension) →
3. PEAK (conflict) →
4. FALLING-RELIEF (resolution) →
5. CALM (more resolution) →
6. REFLECTIVE (takeaway) →
7. WARM-CONNECTING (cta)

### STORYTELLING TECHNIQUES:

- Use sensory details ("The cold tile floor...")
- Include dialogue when possible ("She said...")
- Be specific about time/place ("Tuesday morning, 3am...")
- Show vulnerability, not perfection
- Make the universal feel personal

### TONE FOR STORYTELLING CONTENT:

- Intimate, not distant
- Vivid, not vague
- Honest, not curated
- Engaging, not lecturing
- Human, not branded
