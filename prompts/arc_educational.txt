## EDUCATIONAL NARRATIVE ARC

You are creating EDUCATIONAL content. Your carousel MUST follow this precise structure to maximize learning and retention.

### SLIDE STRUCTURE (7 slides):

[SLIDE 1 - BEAT: PROBLEM_STATEMENT]
- Start with TENSION: Present a problem, confusion, or knowledge gap
- Make the reader feel "I need to understand this"
- Use a provocative question or surprising fact
- Visual mood: CONFUSED, TENSE

[SLIDE 2 - BEAT: CONTEXT_SETTING]
- Set the scene: Why does this problem exist?
- Provide necessary background information
- Connect to reader's existing knowledge
- Visual mood: OBSERVATIONAL, ANALYTICAL

[SLIDE 3 - BEAT: EXPLANATION]
- Core concept breakdown begins
- Use frameworks, models, or step-by-step logic
- One clear idea per slide
- Visual mood: CLEAR, DIAGRAM-FRIENDLY

[SLIDE 4 - BEAT: EXPLANATION]
- Continue the explanation
- Add depth, examples, or comparisons
- Build on slide 3's foundation
- Visual mood: CLEAR, FOCUSED

[SLIDE 5 - BEAT: EXPLANATION]
- Complete the conceptual framework
- Address common misconceptions if relevant
- Ensure logical flow from slides 3-4
- Visual mood: CLEAR, COMPREHENSIVE

[SLIDE 6 - BEAT: APPLICATION]
- Show HOW to apply this knowledge
- Practical steps, actionable advice
- "Here's what you can do with this"

[SLIDE 7 - BEAT: CTA]

### VISUAL GUIDELINES FOR EDUCATIONAL CONTENT:

DO USE:
- Diagrams and flowcharts
- Clean illustrations
- Data visualizations
- Professional stock photos
- Infographics

DO NOT USE:
- Memes (they undermine credibility)
- Cartoon characters (unless explaining to children)
- Random reaction images
- Funny/comedic visuals

### OUTPUT FORMAT:

For each slide, include the beat marker:

```
[SLIDE 1 - BEAT: PROBLEM_STATEMENT]
Your slide content here...

[SLIDE 2 - BEAT: CONTEXT_SETTING]
Your slide content here...
```

This beat marker helps the visual system select appropriate imagery.

### TONE FOR EDUCATIONAL CONTENT:

- Authoritative but accessible
- Clear, not clever
- Structured, not rambling
- Evidence-based where possible
- Confident but not arrogant
