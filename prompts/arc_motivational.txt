## MOTIVATIONAL NARRATIVE ARC

You are creating MOTIVATIONAL content. Your carousel MUST follow this emotional journey to inspire real change.

### SLIDE STRUCTURE (7 slides):

[SLIDE 1 - BEAT: PAIN_POINT]
- Start with a STRUGGLE the reader knows intimately
- Be specific, not generic ("You're tired of..." not "Life is hard")
- Make them think "This is exactly how I feel"
- Visual mood: FRUSTRATED, EXHAUSTED, STUCK

[SLIDE 2 - BEAT: EMPATHY]
- VALIDATE their experience
- Show you understand because you've been there
- "I know this feeling. I lived it."
- Build trust through vulnerability
- Visual mood: UNDERSTANDING, SUPPORTIVE, COMPASSIONATE

[SLIDE 3 - BEAT: SHIFT_MOMENT]
- The TURNING POINT - what changed?
- A realization, a moment, a different way of seeing
- This is the "aha" that unlocks everything
- Visual mood: REALIZATION, LIGHTBULB, EPIPHANY

[SLIDE 4 - BEAT: NEW_PERSPECTIVE]
- Reframe the situation with new insight
- Show the same problem from a empowering angle
- "What if the obstacle IS the way?"
- Visual mood: HOPEFUL, RISING, OPTIMISTIC

[SLIDE 5 - BEAT: NEW_PERSPECTIVE]
- Deepen the new perspective
- Provide more evidence or examples
- Make the new mindset feel achievable
- Visual mood: BRIGHT, FORWARD-LOOKING

[SLIDE 6 - BEAT: ACTION]
- WHAT TO DO NOW - clear, achievable step
- Not a list of 10 things, ONE thing they can do TODAY
- Make it specific and actionable
- Visual mood: DETERMINED, MOVING FORWARD, MOMENTUM

[SLIDE 7 - BEAT: CTA]
- Emotional anchor + call to action
- Remind them of their potential
- Invite them into community (follow, share, comment)
- Visual mood: TEXT-ONLY (no image)

### VISUAL GUIDELINES FOR MOTIVATIONAL CONTENT:

DO USE:
- Aspirational photography (real people, real moments)
- Cinematic scenes that match the emotion
- Powerful imagery that amplifies the feeling
- Before/after type transformations
- Nature imagery for hope/renewal beats

DO NOT USE:
- Memes (they break the emotional spell)
- Cartoon characters (undermines sincerity)
- Generic stock photos (feel fake)
- Overly cheerful images during pain_point/empathy slides

### OUTPUT FORMAT:

For each slide, include the beat marker:

```
[SLIDE 1 - BEAT: PAIN_POINT]
Your slide content here...

[SLIDE 2 - BEAT: EMPATHY]
Your slide content here...
```

This beat marker helps the visual system select emotionally appropriate imagery.

### EMOTIONAL ARC FLOW:

The emotional energy should flow like this:
1. LOW (pain) →
2. LOW-GENTLE (empathy) →
3. RISING (shift) →
4. RISING (new perspective) →
5. HIGH (more perspective) →
6. HIGH-ACTIVE (action) →
7. WARM (cta)

Never break this arc. Don't put a downer after the shift. Don't be preachy during empathy.

### TONE FOR MOTIVATIONAL CONTENT:

- Vulnerable, not perfect
- Direct, not preachy
- Hopeful, not toxic positivity
- Empowering, not condescending
- Real, not performative
