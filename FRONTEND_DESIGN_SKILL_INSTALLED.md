## Design Philosophy

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLES:**
- Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision
- Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is **intentionality**
- Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision
- Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices
- No two designs should be the same

**AVOID:**
- Generic AI-generated aesthetics
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design

## How to Use

Simply ask Claude to create frontend interfaces:

```
"Create a dashboard for a music streaming app"
"Build a landing page for an AI security startup"
"Design a settings panel with dark mode"
"Redesign the Content Studio UI with a brutalist aesthetic"
```

Claude will:
1. Understand the context and purpose
2. Commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction
3. Implement production-ready code with exceptional attention to detail
4. Create visually striking and memorable interfaces

## Aesthetic Directions (Examples)
