## CONTENT ANGLE: Tips/Listicle

**Framework:** Promise → Tip + Context → Tip + Context → Application

**Why It Works:** Lists are scannable, shareable, and satisfying. People love numbered frameworks. Easy to save and reference later.

---

## STRUCTURE:

### Slide 1: THE PROMISE HOOK
Tell them exactly what they're getting + why it matters.

Not: "5 tips for productivity"
But: "5 tactics that doubled my output in 30 days"

**Promise Hook Formulas:**
- "[Number] [things] that [specific result]"
- "[Number] lessons from [timeframe/experience] that [impact]"
- "The [number] [things] I wish I knew [when/time period]"
- "[Number] [things] nobody tells you about [topic]"

### Slide 2-5: THE TIPS
Each tip gets its own slide (or slide pair for complex topics).

Each tip needs:
1. **The Tip** (clear, specific)
2. **Why It Works** (brief reasoning)
3. **How to Apply** (concrete action)

Optional but powerful: Mini story/example

### Slide 6: THE WRAPPER
Tie it together + CTA.

Include:
- Which tip to start with
- Common mistake to avoid
- Encouragement to take action

---

## TIP WRITING FORMULA:

For each tip, follow this pattern:

```
[MEMORABLE NAME/LABEL]

[What it is — 1 sentence]

[Why it matters — 1-2 sentences]

[How to do it — specific action]

[Optional: Quick example]
```

---

## WRITING EXAMPLES:

### Example 1: Productivity (English - Casual Friendly)

**Slide 1:**
```
5 productivity tactics that 10x'd my output.

Learned these the hard way over 3 years.

Sharing so you don't have to.
```

**Slide 2:**
```
1. Eat the Frog First

Do your hardest task before checking anything else.

Why? Decision fatigue is real. Your willpower is highest in the morning.

How: Block first 2 hours. No email. No Slack. Just the hard thing.
```

**Slide 3:**
```
2. Time Boxing > To-Do Lists

Assign time blocks, not just tasks.

Why? Tasks expand to fill time (Parkinson's Law). Boxes force focus.

How: "10-11am: Write report" beats "Write report today"
```

**Slide 4:**
```
3. The 2-Minute Rule

If it takes <2 minutes, do it now. Everything else, schedule it.

Why? Small tasks pile up and create mental clutter.

How: Email response? Do it. Project work? Block time for it.
```

**Slide 5:**
```
4. Single-Tasking Sprints

25 minutes. One task. No interruptions.

Why? Multitasking is a myth. Context switching kills productivity.

How: Phone away. Apps closed. Timer on. Just one thing.
```

**Slide 6:**
```
Start with ONE.

Master it for a week.

Then add the next.

Trying all 5 at once? That's how you do none of them.
```

### Example 2: Career Growth (Bahasa - Santai Gaul)

**Slide 1:**
```
3 hal yang bikin karir gua naik lebih cepat dari peers.

Gak ada yang fancy.
Semua bisa lu mulai hari ini.
```

**Slide 2:**
```
1. Document Everything

Setiap achievement, project, result — gua catat.

Kenapa? Pas performance review, lu gak rely on memory. Lu punya receipts.

How: Bikin doc. Update tiap Jumat. List apa aja yang lu achieve minggu ini.
```

**Slide 3:**
```

 2. Visibility > Perfection

Share work in progress. Jangan tunggu sempurna.

Kenapa? Orang gak bisa appreciate what they don't see. Perfectionists sering invisible.

How: Update team weekly. Share insights di internal channels. Be seen.
```

**Slide 4:**
```
3. Strategic Volunteering

Ambil projects yang:
- Align sama career goal lu
- Gives you visibility to decision makers
- Builds skills lu butuh next

Bukan cuma "help wherever needed."
```

**Slide 5:**
```
Example:

Lu mau jadi manager? Volunteer lead project kecil.

Lu mau pivot ke product? Offer help tim product.

Strategic. Bukan random.
```

**Slide 6:**
```
Gua mulai apply ini 2 tahun lalu.

Promoted 2x faster than expected timeline.

It works. Coba sendiri.
```

## LISTICLE SWEET SPOTS:

### Best Numbers:
- **3 items:** Quick, digestible, memorable
- **5 items:** Comprehensive but not overwhelming
- **7 items:** Maximum before attention drops

Avoid:
- 10+ (too long for carousel)
- 2 (feels incomplete)
- Odd numbers feel more natural than even

---

## TIP TYPES & MIXING:

### Type 1: TACTICAL
Specific action to take
Example: "Use time blocking instead of to-do lists"

### Type 2: MINDSET
Reframe how to think
Example: "Progress > perfection"

### Type 3: AVOID THIS
What NOT to do
Example: "Stop checking email first thing"

### Type 4: HACK/SHORTCUT
Clever workaround
Example: "The 2-minute rule for inbox zero"

**Pro Move:** Mix types for variety
- Tip 1: Tactical
- Tip 2: Mindset
- Tip 3: Avoid this
- Tip 4: Tactical
- Tip 5: Mindset

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

❌ **Generic Advice**
"Work hard" "Stay focused"
→ Be specific: "Block first 2 hours for deep work"

❌ **No Context**
Just listing tips without why
→ Always include brief reasoning

❌ **Too Complex**
Each tip needs a paragraph to explain
→ Simplify or break into multiple posts

❌ **No Hierarchy**
All tips equal importance
→ Lead with best tip or organize by difficulty

❌ **Boring Labels**
"Tip 1" "Tip 2"
→ Give memorable names: "The Frog Rule" "2-Minute Filter"

❌ **No Call to Action**
List ends abruptly
→ Guide them to first step

---

## ENGAGEMENT BOOSTERS:

### In Your Writing:
- Ask "Which one resonates?" in caption
- "Which would you start with?"
- "Am I missing any?"

### Structure Tricks:
- Slide 1: "Can you guess #3?" (creates curiosity)
- Last slide: "Most people skip #2" (makes them check)
- Mid-point: "This one's controversial" (builds interest)

---

## MAKING TIPS MEMORABLE:

### USE LABELS:
❌ "Check email less"
✅ "The Email Embargo" (no email before 10am)

❌ "Focus on one thing"
✅ "The One Thing Rule"

### USE NUMBERS:
❌ "Do it quickly"
✅ "The 2-Minute Rule"

❌ "Take breaks"
✅ "The 52-17 Method" (52 min work, 17 min break)

### USE ANALOGIES:
❌ "Do hard tasks first"
✅ "Eat the Frog" (classic for a reason)

---

## CREDIBILITY BUILDERS:

Make tips trustworthy:

✅ **Personal Proof:**
"This took me from X to Y"

✅ **Time Frame:**
"After 90 days of this..."

✅ **Specificity:**
"Increased output by 340%" > "way more productive"

✅ **Humble Admission:**
"Took me 2 years to figure this out"

✅ **Counter Intuitive:**
"Sounds backwards, but it works"

---

## MEME MATCHING FOR LISTICLES:

### Slide 1 (Promise):
- Usually text-only for clarity
- Or: Confident/knowing energy meme

### Tip Slides:
Option 1: Text-only for all tips (clean, professional)
Option 2: One meme at the "best" tip
Option 3: Meme for most interesting/controversial tip

### Last Slide (Wrapper):
- Encouraging/empowering meme
- Or wise/sage advice energy
- Or back to text-only for clear CTA

**Rule:** Don't force meme on every slide. Sometimes clean text > visual clutter.

---

## LISTICLE VARIATIONS:

### Standard Tips:

## FINAL CHECKLIST:

Before publishing, ensure:

✅ Each tip is specific and actionable
✅ Each tip has reasoning (why it works)
✅ Tips are diverse (not just variations of same thing)
✅ Tips flow in logical order
✅ You've included personal proof/credibility
✅ Last slide guides to first action

---

## FINAL TIPS:

**What Makes Great Listicles:**
- Specificity over generality
- Personal experience over theory
- Actionable over inspirational
- Organized over random
- Credible over inflated

**What Kills Listicles:**
- Generic advice everyone's heard
- No context for why tips work
- Too many tips (information overload)
- No personal proof
- All tips same type (boring)

---

**Remember:**

Anyone can list tips.

Your job is to make them:
- Specific enough to be actionable
- Credible enough to be trusted
- Memorable enough to be applied

Do that, and your listicle becomes a saved resource.

Not just another scroll-past.
